# This GitHub Actions workflow runs your Checkly checks to verify your application after deployments.
# It supports two scenarios:
#
# 1. **With CI/CD Pipeline (deployment_status event):**
#    - Triggers after receiving a Deployment Status event from platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, etc.
#    - Uses the environment_url provided in the deployment event to test against the actual deployed environment
#    - Only runs when the deployment succeeds
#
# 2. **Without CI/CD Pipeline (push event):**
#    - Triggers on every push to main/master branches
#    - Useful for repositories without a deployment pipeline or when using template clones
#
# The workflow automatically detects which scenario applies and adjusts accordingly.
